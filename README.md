# BatchFiles 

Some batch files that I find helpful as shortcuts to move around the Command Line.
There is nothing TERRIBLY useful here yet but as I use the Command Line more and more there should be soon.

Batch Files:

create.bat
Create a batch file and opens it in Sublime.

docs.bat
Goes to the documents folder. (should be global?)

ror.bat
Goes to the folder where I have my Ruby on Rails project files.

u3d.bat
Goes to the directory where Unity3D puts all of the project files.

vs.bat
Runs a Visual Studio project in it's debug directory and pauses before returning.

GLOBAL FILES:

bats.bat
Goes to the directory where these batch files are stored.
