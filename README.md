# BatchFiles 

Some batch files that I find helpful as shortcuts to move around the Command Line.
There is nothing TERRIBLY useful here yet but as I use the Command Line more and more there should be soon.

Second Commit:
All the files had become cumbersome. I am had to create a single file for shortcuts.

GLOBAL FILES:
